# Homebrew formula for the club CLI.
#
# This repo doubles as a Homebrew tap. Because the repo is named `club`
# (not `homebrew-club`), users have to pass the clone URL explicitly —
# `brew tap user/name` only works for repos literally named
# `homebrew-<name>`.
#
#     brew tap birjuvachhani/club https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/club.git
#     brew install club
#
# (If we ever publish a dedicated `homebrew-club` repo mirroring just
# this Formula/ directory, the short form `brew install
# BirjuVachhani/club/club` would start working.)
#
# The formula pulls prebuilt binaries from the GitHub Release matching
# `version` below. When cutting a new release, bump `version` and update
# every sha256 from SHA256SUMS.txt on the release page.
